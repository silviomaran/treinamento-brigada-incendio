No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. <\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-full is-resized\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"327\" height=\"174\" src=\"https:\/\/themes.webswaala.com\/CMS\/WW74\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/services-img-02.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-88\" style=\"width:399px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/themes.webswaala.com\/CMS\/WW74\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/services-img-02.jpg 327w, https:\/\/themes.webswaala.com\/CMS\/WW74\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/services-img-02-300x160.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 327px) 100vw, 327px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. <\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignright size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"327\" height=\"174\" src=\"https:\/\/themes.webswaala.com\/CMS\/WW74\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/services-img-04.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-90\" style=\"width:403px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/themes.webswaala.com\/CMS\/WW74\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/services-img-04.jpg 327w, https:\/\/themes.webswaala.com\/CMS\/WW74\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/services-img-04-300x160.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 327px) 100vw, 327px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry\u2019s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. One disadvantage of Lorum Ipsum is that in Latin certain letters appear more frequently than others &#8211; which creates a distinct visual impression. Moreover, in Latin only words at the beginning of sentences are capitalized<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>this means that Lorem Ipsum cannot accurately represent, for example, German, in which all nouns are capitalized. Thus, Lorem Ipsum has only limited suitability as a visual filler for German texts. If the fill text is intended to illustrate the characteristics of different typefaces, it sometimes makes sense to select texts containing the various letters and symbols specific to the output language.<\/p>\n\n    <div class=\"xs_social_share_widget xs_share_url after_content \t\tmain_content  wslu-style-1 wslu-share-box-shaped wslu-fill-colored wslu-none wslu-share-horizontal wslu-theme-font-no wslu-main_content\">\n\n\t\t\n        <ul>\n\t\t\t        <\/ul>\n    <\/div> \n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":132,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_kad_post_transparent":"","_kad_post_title":"","_kad_post_layout":"","_kad_post_sidebar_id":"","_kad_post_content_style":"","_kad_post_vertical_padding":"","_kad_post_feature":"","_kad_post_feature_position":"","_kad_post_header":false,"_kad_post_footer":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-143","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-uncategorized"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/themes.webswaala.com\/CMS\/WW74\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/143","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/themes.webswaala.com\/CMS\/WW74\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/themes.webswaala.com\/CMS\/WW74\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/themes.webswaala.com\/CMS\/WW74\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/themes.webswaala.com\/CMS\/WW74\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=143"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/themes.webswaala.com\/CMS\/WW74\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/143\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":451,"href":"https:\/\/themes.webswaala.com\/CMS\/WW74\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/143\/revisions\/451"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/themes.webswaala.com\/CMS\/WW74\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/132"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/themes.webswaala.com\/CMS\/WW74\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=143"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/themes.webswaala.com\/CMS\/WW74\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=143"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/themes.webswaala.com\/CMS\/WW74\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=143"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
